In a GAN, we build two different neural networks. Our first network is a traditional classification network, called the **discriminator**. We will train the discriminator to take images, and classify them as being real (belonging to the training set) or fake (not present in the training set). Our other network, called the **generator**, will take random noise as input and transform it using a neural network to produce images. The goal of the generator is to fool the discriminator into thinking the images it produced are real.\n","\n","We can think of this back and forth process of the generator ($G$) trying to fool the discriminator ($D$), and the discriminator trying to correctly classify real vs. fake as a minimax game:\n","$$\\underset{G}{\\text{minimize}}\\; \\underset{D}{\\text{maximize}}\\; \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_\\text{data}}\\left[\\log D(x)\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}\\left[\\log \\left(1-D(G(z))\\right)\\right]$$\n","where $x \\sim p_\\text{data}$ are samples from the input data, $z \\sim p(z)$ are the random noise samples, $G(z)$ are the generated images using the neural network generator $G$, and $D$ is the output of the discriminator, specifying the probability of an input being real. In [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), they analyze this minimax game and show how it relates to minimizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the training data distribution and the generated samples from $G$.\n","\n","To optimize this minimax game, we will aternate between taking gradient *descent* steps on the objective for $G$, and gradient *ascent* steps on the objective for $D$:\n","1. update the **generator** ($G$) to minimize the probability of the __discriminator making the correct choice__. \n","2. update the **discriminator** ($D$) to maximize the probability of the __discriminator making the correct choice__.\n","\n","While these updates are useful for analysis, they do not perform well in practice. Instead, we will use a different objective when we update the generator: maximize the probability of the **discriminator making the incorrect choice**. This small change helps to allevaiate problems with the generator gradient vanishing when the discriminator is confident. This is the standard update used in most GAN papers, and was used in the original paper from [Goodfellow et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). \n","\n","In this assignment, we will alternate the following updates:\n","1. Update the generator ($G$) to maximize the probability of the discriminator making the incorrect choice on generated data:\n","$$\\underset{G}{\\text{maximize}}\\;  \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p(z)}\\left[\\log D(G(z))\\right]$$\n","2.

Compared to other approaches for generative models, they often produce the highest quality samples but are some of the most difficult and finicky models to train (see [this github repo](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks) that contains a set of 17 hacks that are useful for getting models working). Improving the stabiilty and robustness of GAN training is an open research question, with new papers coming out every day! For a more recent tutorial on GANs, see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160). There is also some even more recent exciting work that changes the objective function to Wasserstein distance and yields much more stable results across model architectures: [WGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875), [WGAN-GP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028).\n","\n","\n","GANs are not the only way to train a generative model! For other approaches to generative modeling check out the [deep generative model chapter](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/generative_models.html) of the Deep Learning [book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org). Another popular way of training neural networks as generative models is Variational Autoencoders (co-discovered [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4082)). Variational autoencoders combine neural networks with variational inference to train deep generative models. These models tend to be far more stable and easier to train but currently don't produce samples that are as pretty as GANs.\n","\n","Example pictures of what you should expect (yours might look slightly different):\n","\n","![caption](gan_outputs_tf.png)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-0Pqg4YTmyDL"},"source":["## Setup"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore"],"id":"7V_jDvnpmyDL","outputId":"9674cfac-b8a2-497d-ca7f-2e986e27d1a0","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1646261119595,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":3485,"user":{"displayName":"ManinMoon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi-hOuLuMvjuGaJGP-diHLHkun047H5mp1W_G1I=s64","userId":"11384695163455928048"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:516: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_qint8 = np.dtype([(\"qint8\", np.int8, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:517: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_quint8 = np.dtype([(\"quint8\", np.uint8, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:518: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_qint16 = np.dtype([(\"qint16\", np.int16, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:519: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_quint16 = np.dtype([(\"quint16\", np.uint16, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:520: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_qint32 = np.dtype([(\"qint32\", np.int32, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:525: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  np_resource = np.dtype([(\"resource\", np.ubyte, 1)])\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1.14.0\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorboard/compat/tensorflow_stub/dtypes.py:541: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_qint8 = np.dtype([(\"qint8\", np.int8, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorboard/compat/tensorflow_stub/dtypes.py:542: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_quint8 = np.dtype([(\"quint8\", np.uint8, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorboard/compat/tensorflow_stub/dtypes.py:543: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_qint16 = np.dtype([(\"qint16\", np.int16, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorboard/compat/tensorflow_stub/dtypes.py:544: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_quint16 = np.dtype([(\"quint16\", np.uint16, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorboard/compat/tensorflow_stub/dtypes.py:545: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  _np_qint32 = np.dtype([(\"qint32\", np.int32, 1)])\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorboard/compat/tensorflow_stub/dtypes.py:550: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.\n","  np_resource = np.dtype([(\"resource\", np.ubyte, 1)])\n"]}],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","# I am using tensorflow version 1.14.

The first part shows its ability to recognize real images, independent of the generator; the second part shows its ability to recognize generated images. If the loss of the generator decreases, then its ability to fool the discriminator has improved. The loss of the discriminator has remained large, probably because the discriminator is too poor, and even the ability to recognize real pictures is poor. In extreme cases, the discriminator is guessing with a probability of 50%. Therefore, the reduction of generator loss is also likely because the discriminator is too bad and easy to be deceived."],"metadata":{"id":"BxQGxOeuIg2q"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.1"},"colab":{"name":"EE 435 Hw #5.ipynb","provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
